## Notes about this version
This is a fork of the [original repo](https://github.com/threema-ch/threema-msgapi-sdk-php) after it was announced that the GitHub-version is no longer maintained by Threema.
As this is the community version of the Threema Gateway PHP SDK it may contain additional changes which are not yet included in the official downloadable version on the Threema website. If you are looking for a simple mirror of the downloadable Threema version you can switch to the branch [`official`](https://github.com/rugk/threema-msgapi-sdk-php/tree/official).  
More information are avaliable in [the wiki](https://github.com/rugk/threema-msgapi-sdk-php/wiki/Branches-and-releases).

An automatically created documentation of this SDK can be found [on GitHub Pages](https://rugk.github.io/threema-msgapi-sdk-php/).

The contributors of this repository are not affiliated with Threema or the Threema GmbH.

## Installation
- Install PHP 5.4 or later: [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- For better encryption performance, install the [libsodium PHP extension](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-php).

  This step is optional; if the libsodium PHP extension is not available, the SDK will automatically fall back to (slower) pure PHP code for ECC encryption (file and image sending not supported).

  A 64bit version of PHP is required for pure PHP encryption.

  To install the libsodium PHP extension:

  ```ShellSession
  pecl install libsodium
  ```

  Then add the following line to your php.ini file:

  ```ini
  extension=libsodium.so
  ```

If you want to check whether your server meets the requirements and everything is configured properly you can execute `threema-msgapi-tool.php` without any parameters on the console or point your browser to the location where it is saved on your server.

If you want to use this library in your own product it is recommend to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and require  [`rugk/threema-msgapi-sdk-php`](https://packagist.org/packages/rugk/threema-msgapi-sdk-php).

## SDK usage
### Creating a connection

```php
use Threema\MsgApi\Connection;
use Threema\MsgApi\ConnectionSettings;
use Threema\MsgApi\Receiver;

require_once('lib/bootstrap.php');

//define your connection settings
$settings = new ConnectionSettings(
    '*THREEMA',
    'THISISMYSECRET'
);

//simple php file to store the public keys (this file must already exist)
$publicKeyStore = new Threema\MsgApi\PublicKeyStores\PhpFile('/path/to/my/keystore.php');

//create a connection
$connector = new Connection($settings, $publicKeyStore);
```

### Creating a connection with advanced options
**Attention:** These settings change internal values of the TLS connection. Choosing wrong settings can weaken the TLS connection or prevent a successful connection to the server. Use them with care!

Each of the additional options shown below is optional. You can leave it out or use `null` to use the default value determinated by cURL for this option.

```php
use Threema\MsgApi\Connection;
use Threema\MsgApi\ConnectionSettings;
use Threema\MsgApi\Receiver;

require_once('lib/bootstrap.php');

//define your connection settings
$settings = new ConnectionSettings(
    '*THREEMA',
    'THISISMYSECRET',
    null, //the host to be used, set to null to use the default (recommend)
    [
        'forceHttps' => true, //set to true to force HTTPS, default: false
        'tlsVersion' => '1.2', //set the version of TLS to be used, default: null
        'tlsCipher' => 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384' //choose a cipher or a list of ciphers, default: null
        'pinnedKey' => 'sha256//8SLubAXo6MrrGziVya6HjCS/Cuc7eqtzw1v6AfIW57c=;sha256//8kTK9HP1KHIP0sn6T2AFH3Bq+qq3wn2i/OJSMjewpFw=' // the hashes to pin, the default is shown here, it is NOT recommend to change this value!
    ]
);

//simple php file to store the public keys (this file must already exist)
$publicKeyStore = new Threema\MsgApi\PublicKeyStores\PhpFile('/path/to/my/keystore.php');

//create a connection
$connector = new Connection($settings, $publicKeyStore);
```

If you want to get a list of all ciphers you can use have a look at the [SSLLabs scan](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=msgapi.threema.ch&latest), at the list of all available [OpenSSL ciphers](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/ciphers.html) and the [comparison table by Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Cipher_names_correspondence_table) which also has some suggestions for good ciphers you should use.

**Note:** For `pinnedKey` to work you must install cURL 7.39 or higher. It is also recommend to use PHP 7.0.7 or higher if you want to support this feature, but it is not required.
You can test whether it works by specifying an invalid pin.

### Sending a text message to a Threema ID (Simple Mode)

```php
//create the connection
//(...)
//create a receiver
$receiver = new Receiver('ABCD1234', Receiver::TYPE_ID);

$result = $connector->sendSimple($receiver, "This is a Test Message");
if($result->isSuccess()) {
    echo 'new id created '.$result->getMessageId();
}
else {
    echo 'error '.$result->getErrorMessage();
}
```

### Sending a text message to a Threema ID (E2E Mode)

```php
//create the connection
//(...)

$e2eHelper = new \Threema\MsgApi\Helpers\E2EHelper($senderPrivateKey,$connector);
$result = $e2eHelper->sendTextMessage("TEST1234", "This is an end-to-end encrypted message");

if(true === $result->isSuccess()) {
    echo 'Message ID: '.$result->getMessageId() . "\n";
}
else {
    echo 'Error: '.$result->getErrorMessage() . "\n";
}
```

### Sending a file message to a Threema ID (E2E Mode)

```php
//create the connection
//(...)

$senderPrivateKey = "MY_PUBLIC_KEY_IN_BIN";
$filePath = "/path/to/my/file.pdf";

$e2eHelper = new \Threema\MsgApi\Helpers\E2EHelper($senderPrivateKey,$connector);
$result = $e2eHelper->sendFileMessage("TEST1234", $filePath);

if(true === $result->isSuccess()) {
    echo 'File Message ID: '.$result->getMessageId() . "\n";
}
else {
    echo 'Error: '.$result->getErrorMessage() . "\n";
}
```
